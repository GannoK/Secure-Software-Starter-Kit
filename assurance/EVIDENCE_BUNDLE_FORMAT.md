# Evidence Bundle Format

Assurance evidence should be reproducible and attributable to a specific repository state.

Recommended bundle:

- `repository_commit`
- `generated_at`
- `tool_version`
- `assurance_profile`
- `results[]` with `control_id`, `status`, `evidence`, and `notes`
- checksum of the repository manifest
- unresolved `MANUAL`, `UNKNOWN`, and `WAIVED` items

Allowed result states are `PASS`, `FAIL`, `MANUAL`, `N/A`, `UNKNOWN`, and `WAIVED`.

`UNKNOWN` never implies `PASS`. `MANUAL` requires recorded human evidence before promotion to `PASS`. `WAIVED` requires rationale and an expiration or review date.

For software releases, the evidence bundle should additionally record artifact checksums, source commit, workflow identity, applicable standards profile versions, security exceptions, and provenance-attestation identifiers.
